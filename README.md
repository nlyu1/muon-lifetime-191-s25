# Muon Lifetime Experiment (Physics 191)

This repository contains the experimental data, analysis, and documentation for the Muon Lifetime Experiment conducted at Harvard University.

## Project Goals

1. Measure the muon lifetime (τ_μ) and extract the weak force coupling constant (G_F)
2. Determine the muon rest mass through decay electron energy spectrum analysis

## Experiment Overview

The experiment measures muon lifetime by observing cosmic ray muon decay in a plastic scintillator setup. The detection system uses photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and specialized triggering to identify muon stop and decay events. The analysis involves fitting exponential decay curves to extract the muon lifetime and analyzing energy spectra to determine the muon rest mass.

## Safety Considerations

- PMTs operate at high voltages (-2.0 kV to -2.4 kV)
- No hot-plugging of high voltage connections
- Proper electrical shielding required
- Cosmic ray exposure poses no significant health risk
